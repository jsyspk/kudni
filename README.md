# Kudni 

A modern next generation framework for PHP 7.4+

Everything that follows is strongly opinionated but tries to stick with the better standards & best practices.

## Why?

A lot is happening in the php world right now and new frameworks are emerging every now and then.
 
There are some fundamental issues that forced the creation of this framework and the libraries that are going to follow.

- capitalization of file names and directories. Something that didn't make much sense, but when you are in linux, the nonsense grows exponentially.
- adding directories just for the sake of composer. Nested directories hell.
- adding namespaces and title casing just for the composer. Again, name-spacing without understanding the essence of namespaces.
- interfaces just for the sake of interface. A lot of classes like ICompany or DepartmentInterface etc. 

Composer has done a great job but it has also killed the name-spacing feature's essence.

This framework is just a small step towards a better and cleaner php-world.
